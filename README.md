## NAME_OF_YOUR_APP_HERE: Code Path Pre-Work
    

### App Description

`TODO://` 
    This is an IOS app designed to work best on the iPhone 11 screen. It helps students introduce themselves by showing a logo of their school on the first page. They then enter their first and last names, and their school name in 3 text fields.

    There's also a section to select the student's current academic year using a Segmented Control. Next, they use a stepper (set to 0 by default) to tell how many pets they have. There's also a switch to indicate if they want more pets.

    When they're ready, they press the "Introduce Self" button at the bottom of the page. This generates an alert box with all their information combined into one short introduction paragraph.
    
    Additionlly the user may click on "Change Background" button, that would change the color of a background of a general view.
